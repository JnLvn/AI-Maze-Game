### John Lavin
#### G00192754

Project for my Artificial Intelligence module. 

Maze game with some AI features.


## How to run

Run from Runner.java class in package ie.gmit.sw

##Maze Generator

####Random Depth First Search 
was used to generate my maze.

##Enemies 

####Random Walk algorithm
was used to initialize movement for enemies.

##Generate Hint/Clue

####A Star algorithm
was used to find the exit to maze.

Didn't quite get this to work.

##Fuzzy Logic

####fightScene.fcl
contains my fuzzy logic for all the fights in the maze game.

The Fight.java class implements this fcl file.

The fights in the maze work sometimes and not others...BUG!!!
